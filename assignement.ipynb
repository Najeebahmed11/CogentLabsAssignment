      "3. Create a Study Environment: Find a quiet and well-lit space to study. Remove distractions such as phones or social media during study sessions.\n",
      "4. Time Management Techniques: Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break) to improve focus and productivity.\n",
      "5. Utilize Spare Time: Take advantage of short breaks between activities to review concepts or solve quick practice problems.\n",
      "6. Seek Help: If you encounter difficulties in time management or understanding concepts, don't hesitate to reach out to teachers, peers, or online forums for assistance.\n",
      "7. Take Breaks: Allow yourself some downtime to relax and recharge. Engage in activities you enjoy to maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n",
